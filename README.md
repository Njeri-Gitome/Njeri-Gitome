## About 
I am an ardent data nerd. I enjoy uncovering meaningful insights and driving informed decision making through rigorous and empathetic analysis.

I have previously have enjoyed working in the Telecommunication sector as a Technical Pre-sales Engineer for a period of 1.5 years. It was a rewarding experience whereby in addition to the technical sales position I engaged in Business Development, Project Management and Telecommunication Network Planning. 

Additionally, I have to work as a Market Researcher at a Marketing Agency. Whereby my forte in Data Analysis was sharpened, I also got to participate in Business Strategy and Planning, and Business Proposal Writing.

My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:
I can align, lead and grow a top-notch Research team:
 - I love to win, but helping my team win gives me greater joy.
 - I tell compelling stories especially when using visual aids.

I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person especially in the business ecosystem and passionately contribute through my technical and tech skills. 

I am in the process of switching to a career in Data Science, with a focus on providing business solutions within the Sustainable Development Goals. I am excited to utilize my technical know-how and business acumen to improve firms' operations.
