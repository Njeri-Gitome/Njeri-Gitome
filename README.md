I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering and have 1.5 years of experience in Technical Engineering Pre-sales for Telecommunications equipment. Additionally, I have 2 years of experience in Business Development. However, I am currently in the process of transitioning to a career in Data Science, with a focus on providing business solutions in the healthcare domain. I am excited to utilize my technical expertise and business acumen to help organizations improve their operations and make a positive impact in the healthcare industry.
